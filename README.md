# Tech Quiz Today

Tech Quiz Today is a website, designed to interest and challenge tech enthusiasts

## Features

Quiz: A fully functioning quiz with 10 questions is included. Questions are randomised, ensuring that each site user ahs a unique experience.

Future Plans: Proper implementation of scoring and username features.

## Testing

Code was validated through the [W3 Official Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for HTML, and the [W3S Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for CSS.

Extensive testing was conducted, with many bugs being resolved. Early on, there were syntax errors in the javascript, preventing the quiz functionality. This led to extensive troubleshooting, with some issues delaying development due to their prominence. Specifically, a certain function, necessary for displaying the question failed to fire until a small grammatical error was fixed.

## Unfixed Bugs

The answer buttons are supposed to change to either green or red, depending if the answer is right or wrong. For whatever reason, the style will not apply to the buttons. Even after significant troubleshooting, I was unable to resolve this issue. An attempt to tell users they had the right answer through alerts was also unsuccessful. Hero Image is also very enlarged, unfortunately did not have time to resolve this.

## Deployment

After I was satisfied with my work in Gitpod, I then pushed my work to Github. The website was then deployed via Github.

## Credits

Content: [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=WL&index=84) was an invaluable resource throughout the project. Initially, when beginning the javascript portion of this project, I was slightly lost. I watched a few of their tutorials, which helped greatly expand my knowledge from the course. Several sections of javascript were based on the video tutorial linked as well, and were adapted for this project. Specifically, several functions (labelled), as well as the basis for my styling.  Font was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Media: Hero image was pulled from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

Extra Help: Some general questions of mine for the project were answered in the Slack channels. Also benefitted from some advice from my mentor.
