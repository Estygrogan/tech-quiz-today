# Tech Quiz Today

Tech Quiz Today is a website, designed to interest and challenge tech enthusiasts

## Features

Navigation: The navigation bar, in the top right corner, allows users to navigate to the three main sections: Home, Schedule and Register. This should allow the user to easily navigate the sections of the website.

Landing Image: The top of the Website shows a hero image, with text giving a brief summary of what this site is for. The name "Meath Gaming" also makes it clear to potential users that this is a site focused on the Meath area.

Future Plans: Possible movement of signup sheet to improve accessibility.

## Testing

Code was validated through the [W3 Official Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for HTML, and the [W3S Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for CSS.

Extensive testing was conducted, with many bugs being resolved. Early on, there were issues with alignment due to float CSS, mainly with one of the images in the Why Join Us section. Due to the stylistic switch to a black background, there were initially issues with text appearing incorrectly. This was resolved by setting the font colour to white in the body style.  Lighthouse testing scores were poor due to font contrasts, colors of backgrounds were adjusted to reflect this.

## Unfixed Bugs

Footer is not currently staying at bottom of page. CSS was written to remedy this, however nothing has worked to achieve this. Troubleshooting has not led to a working solution.

## Deployment

After I was satisfied with my work in Gitpod, I then pushed my work to Github. The website was then deployed via Github.
