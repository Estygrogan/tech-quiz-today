# Tech Quiz Today

Tech Quiz Today is a website, designed to interest and challenge tech enthusiasts. Tech is an area I am passionatea bout, and making this quiz helped me learn some fun facts about the industry. I hope this quiz can educate users in the same way.

## Features

Quiz: A fully functioning quiz with 10 questions is included. Questions are randomised, ensuring that each site user ahs a unique experience.

Responsiveness: When selecting an answer, the quiz tells you if you are right or wrong, depending on the colour the answer buttons change to. If correct, the answer button changes to green, if incorrect, red. When all questions are answered, the quiz allows you to restart.

Future Plans: Proper implementation of scoring and username features.

## Testing

Code was validated through the [W3 Official Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for HTML, and the [W3S Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) for CSS.

Extensive testing was conducted, with many bugs being resolved. Early on, there were syntax errors in the javascript, preventing the quiz functionality. This led to extensive troubleshooting, with some issues delaying development due to their prominence. Specifically, a certain function, necessary for displaying the question failed to fire until a small grammatical error was fixed.

## Unfixed Bugs

Main unfixed bug is implementation of scoring system, stil not tracking as I had intended.

## Deployment

After I was satisfied with my work in Gitpod, I then pushed my work to Github. The website was then deployed via Github.

## Credits

Content: [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&list=WL&index=84) was an invaluable resource throughout the project. Initially, when beginning the javascript portion of this project, I was slightly lost. I watched a few of their tutorials, which helped greatly expand my knowledge from the course. Several sections of javascript were based on the video tutorial linked as well, and were adapted for this project. Specifically, several functions (labelled), as well as the basis for my styling.  Font was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

Media: Hero image was pulled from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). 

Extra Help: Some general questions of mine for the project were answered in the Slack channels. Also benefitted from some advice from my mentor.
